This Project is for Internet Application Course Project using ASP .NET MVC Technology.
<br>I Participated in this Projet by Designing the Database, Completing Pages : Home, Add Paper, Paper Profile, Contact and About Pages

## Main Features
* Author creates an account
* Author login to his/her account and edit his/her profile (profile image, first name, last name, university, department, email, mobile).
* Author profile must also include all his/her published papers, and please note that each paper can be written by more than one author, which means that if we opened a certain paper, then we can see the paper details plus the other participated authors, and we can click on any of these participated authors which will open their profiles.
* Authors login to his/her account and upload papers to his/her profile.
* Author can search for other authors by email or name or university, and open the profiles of the selected authors to check their latest published papers.
* Author can access other authors’ profiles and see their papers.
* Author can open other authors’ papers and write comments.
